Code in this repository is used for analyisng the intererogram from atoms passing through a multi-slit grating. This matter-wave interferometer deomnstrates 
the matter-wave duality of atoms and the resulting pattern can be used to determine the atom's velocity when passing through the grating.

The input data was the image o accumualted atomic position measurements processed in 'Matter-wave aquisition'. A horizontal profile of the interfernce pattern 
is uploaded in the initial data input section.

The data is standardised and trimmed. In some cases the data is also filtered.

Regression analysis was used to fit the equation taken from previous research to the data. A polynomial least squares analysis was used to find the atomic mean velocity 
and velocity spread.

The large number of variables required mapping the residual across the 2-D parameter space
